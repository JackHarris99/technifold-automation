We were utterly amazed when we tried the adjustable version of the Quad Creaser...it had colour coded ribs that corresponded to different crease styles, and it further improved the quality of covers. Not only does the system eliminate fibre-cracking, but it also minimises the reset force of the cover. The Quad Creaser has allowed Kosel to raise its own quality standards for bound products.",
