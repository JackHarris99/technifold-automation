# Creasing vs Scoring: The Critical Difference

> Why the printing industry has been doing it wrong since 1850

## The Fundamental Problem

OEM scoring tools used in folding machines have **not evolved since 1850**. They use thin spring steel blades that:
- Create V-shaped indentations that concentrate pressure
- Damage and break paper fibres
- Result in cracking along fold lines
- Perform worse on modern coated and digital stocks

## Scoring: The Old Way

### How OEM Scoring Works
- Thin metal blade presses into paper against metal anvil
- Creates a V-shaped groove
- **Cuts and damages fibres** at the fold line
- Weakens the paper at exactly the point of stress

### Why It Fails on Modern Stocks
- Digital print toners are brittle
- UV coatings crack under V-shaped stress
- Laminate films lift and separate
- Heavy stocks split completely
- Cross-grain folding causes severe cracking

### The V-Shape Problem
```
        ▼ Pressure concentrated at point
       /\
      /  \
     /    \   V-shaped score
    /      \  (damages fibres)
   /________\
```

## Creasing: The Technifold Way

### How Technifold Creasing Works
- Specially formulated rubber rib presses paper into female channel
- Creates a U-shaped groove
- **Stretches and deforms fibres** without breaking them
- Prepares paper to fold cleanly

### Why It Works
- Pressure distributed across wider surface
- Fibres stretched incrementally, not severed
- Material "wants" to fold along crease line
- Works with grain or against grain
- Rubber is "digital friendly" - no toner damage

### The U-Shape Advantage
```
       ▼▼▼ Pressure distributed
      |   |
      |   |  U-shaped crease
      |   |  (stretches fibres)
      |___|
```

## The Reverse Crease Method

**The Breakthrough Discovery** by Graham Harris (Technifold founder):

Traditional thinking: Crease on the inside (where fold will be)
Reality: This causes cracking because fibres compress and buckle

**Technifold Method**: Crease on the **outside** (top) so the bulge/bead is on the inside after folding

### Why It Works
- Outer fibres stretched during creasing
- When folded, stretched fibres are now on inside
- Inside fibres have room to compress into crease channel
- No buckling, no cracking, clean fold

### The Test
Harris tested 5 leading scoring devices worldwide before inventing the Tri-Creaser. Only the reverse crease method matched proven Heidelberg Cylinder letterpress results.

## Comparison Table

| Factor | OEM Scoring | Technifold Creasing |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Shape | V-shaped | U-shaped |
| Fibre Treatment | Cuts/damages | Stretches/prepares |
| Penetration | Shallow | 3x deeper |
| Settings | 1 fixed | 8 adjustable |
| Digital Stocks | Poor results | Excellent |
| UV/Laminate | Cracks/lifts | Clean folds |
| Technology Age | 1850 (unchanged) | Modern patented |

## Third-Party Validation

**Sappi Paper Engineering Report:**
> "The quality of this creasing is comparable with that produced in letterpress printing"

Sappi testing showed:
- Conventional creasing "not satisfactory" on high basis weights
- Tri-Creaser achieved "optimal result" even on 350 g/m² stock

## Common Myths Busted

### Myth 1: "Always fold with the grain"
**Truth**: On 7-15pt stocks, better results folding AGAINST grain with proper creasing

### Myth 2: "Can't crease in rotary form"
**Truth**: Incremental delamination in rotary works just as well as platen

### Myth 3: "Can't use UV coating on folded pieces"
**Truth**: Good crease eliminates cracking even on UV coated stocks

### Myth 4: "Need letterpress for premium results"
**Truth**: Tri-Creaser delivers letterpress-quality creasing on folders

## Bottom Line

**Scoring** = Cutting fibres (1850s technology, destructive)
**Creasing** = Stretching fibres (modern technology, preserving)

For crack-free folds on any stock, switch from scoring to creasing.
