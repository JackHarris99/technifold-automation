# The Technifold Colour-Coding System

> Eliminates operator guesswork - anyone can become an instant expert

## The Problem with OEM Setup

Traditional folding machine setup requires:
- Years of operator experience
- Trial and error on each job
- Guesswork about settings
- Wasted time and materials
- Inconsistent results between operators

## The Technifold Solution

**Colour-coded ribs and channels** that match stock weights:
- See the colour → Know the setting
- No guesswork required
- Inexperienced operators get expert results
- Consistent quality regardless of who runs the job

## The Standard Colour System

### For Creasing Ribs (Tri-Creaser, Quad-Creaser, etc.)

| Colour | Stock Weight | Hardness | Notes |
|--------|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Orange** | 85-200gsm | Hardest | Longest life, thin stocks |
| **Blue** | 200-270gsm | Medium | Most versatile |
| **Yellow** | 250-350gsm | Softest | Heavy stocks |
| **Black w/Yellow Dot** | Heavy/Laminate | - | Laminated stocks |
| **All-Black** | Extra-Heavy Laminate | - | Optional, special applications |

### The Hardness Logic

**Harder ribs (Orange)** for thinner stocks:
- Thin paper needs firm, defined crease
- Longer lasting due to material properties
- Most common everyday use

**Softer ribs (Yellow)** for heavier stocks:
- Heavy card needs gentler pressure
- Rubber conforms to thick material
- Prevents crushing or tearing

## How to Use the System

### Step 1: Identify Stock Weight
Check the paper specifications (gsm/pt)

### Step 2: Match to Colour
| Stock | Use |
|-------|-----|
| Under 200gsm | Orange |
| 200-270gsm | Blue |
| Over 250gsm | Yellow |
| Laminated | Black variants |

### Step 3: Match Male and Female
The female channel should match the male rib colour

### Step 4: Run the Job
No further adjustment needed for most jobs

## Overlap Zones

Notice the stock weight ranges overlap:
- Orange: 85-**200**gsm
- Blue: **200**-270gsm
- Yellow: **250**-350gsm

This is intentional. In the overlap zones, either colour will work. Choose based on:
- **Lighter end of range**: Use the harder rib
- **Heavier end of range**: Use the softer rib
- **Problem stocks**: Try the softer option first

## Consumable Longevity by Colour

Harder ribs last longer:

### 35mm Shaft Devices (Folders)
| Colour | Standard Life | EnduraCrease Life |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Orange | 1,000,000 sheets | 1,300,000 sheets |
| Blue | 600,000 sheets | 780,000 sheets |
| Yellow | 300,000 sheets | 390,000 sheets |

### Perfect Binder Applications
| Colour | Life |
|--------|------|
| Orange | 900,000 - 1,200,000 sheets |
| Blue | 659,000 - 1,000,000 sheets |
| Yellow | 300,000 - 900,000 sheets |

**Note**: 25mm shaft devices have approximately 40% shorter life

## Related: 8 Settings System

Beyond colour-coding, Technifold devices offer 8 crease settings within each colour, achieved by:
- Different channel widths in the female component
- Varying pressure settings
- Split rib positioning

This provides fine-tuning capability while maintaining the simplicity of colour-coded starting points.
