# Quad-Creaser Technology

> Four-crease spine and hinge creasing for perfect binding machines

## What It Does

Creates up to **4 close-proximity creases** on book covers just after the cover feeder and just before the cover is glued to the book block. The creases form the spine and hinges of perfect-bound books.

## Machine Type

**Perfect Binders** - sits in the cover feeder section

## Key Benefits

### Eliminates Dual Problems
1. **Laminate lifting** on coated/laminated covers
2. **Fibre cracking** on the spine and hinges

### More Versatile Than OEM
- Much deeper and wider crease settings available
- OEM metal score has fixed, limited settings
- Adjustable for any spine width and hinge requirements

### Letterpress Quality
- Produces letterpress-quality creasing
- No ripping or tearing

### Simple Operation
- Easy to use
- Saves time
- Reduces outsourcing costs

### Specially Designed Components
- Split creasing ribs for fast setting changes
- Can be pre-set using red spacers for correct crease-to-crease distance
