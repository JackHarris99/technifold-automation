# Multi-Tool Technology

> Modular combination finishing: slit, trim, kiss-cut, micro-perforate, edge-trim in one device

## CRITICAL NOTE: NAMING CHAOS

The Multi-Tool product line has **severe naming/numbering inconsistencies** across historical documents:
- At least 3 different "Option" numbering schemes exist
- Pricing varied from £389 to £649 for the same thing
- Document dates and versions are inconsistent

**Marketing Strategy**: Focus on CAPABILITIES, not option numbers or variant names.

## The 6 Core Capabilities

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|-------------|
| **Single Micro-Perforation** | One row of fine perforations |
| **Close Proximity Perforation** | Two perforations as little as 4mm apart |
| **Kiss-Cut** | Half-cut applications (cuts through stock but not backing) |
| **Single Cut** | High quality guillotine-style single slit |
| **Double Cut** | Two parallel cuts |
| **Edge Trimming** | Clean cut edge trimming with waste removal |

### Self-Sharpening
- Double-sided and hardened cutting bosses self-sharpen during production

### Micro-Perforation Quality
- Simulates letterpress application
- Available TPI: 12, 17, 25, 52, 72 (12 and 72 on request)
- Nearly invisible results possible

### Trouble-Free Edge Trimming
- Blue waste gripper band ensures clean waste removal
- Guaranteed trouble-free production

## Technical Details

### Perforation Blade Options
| TPI | Best For |
|-----|----------|
| 12 | Very heavy stock |
| 17 | Heavy stock |
| 25 | Medium weight |
| 52 | Lightweight (nearly invisible) |
| 72 | Ultra-fine (special request) |

### Close Proximity Capability
- Two micro-perforations from as little as **4-5mm apart**
- Impossible with standard single micro-perf tools

## Customer Testimonial

**Tony Morgan, Bindery Manager, Bezier Corporate Print, Dorset**:
> "The quality of cut is as good as a guillotine"

## Machine Compatibility

Works on most popular folding machines (specific compatibility via product_code matching)

## Consumable Longevity

| Component | Life Expectancy |
|-----------|----------------|
| Cutting Blades | 8,000,000 sheets |
| Perforation Blades | 8,000,000 sheets |
| Kiss-Cutting Blades | 4,000,000 sheets |
| Nylon Sleeve | 1,000,000 sheets |

## Quote Builder Logic

For Multi-Tool quotes, may need qualification:
1. What operations does customer need? (perf, cut, edge-trim, combinations?)
2. Close proximity work required?
3. Single tool versatility OR dedicated tools?

If customer needs ONLY cutting: Edge Trimmer may be more cost-effective
If customer needs combinations: Full Multi-Tool pack
If customer needs close proximity perf+crease: May need CP Applicator instead

## Notes for Marketing

- **DO NOT** use option numbers (they're inconsistent)
- **DO** focus on outcomes: "guillotine-quality cutting", "nearly invisible perforations"
- **DO** emphasize modular/upgradeable nature
- **DO** mention blade longevity (major cost saving)
- This is a complex product - sales consultation often needed
