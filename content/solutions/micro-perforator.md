# Micro-Perforator Technology

> Produces nearly invisible, letterpress-quality perforations inline on folding machines

## What It Does

Creates clean tear-off perforations using interchangeable blades and a kiss-cut technique. The perforation wheel just touches (or slightly cuts into) a nylon female collar - never cutting fully through.

## Key Benefits

### Nearly Invisible Results
- Up to 72 teeth per inch (TPI) for ultra-fine perforations
- "Almost invisible perf" that looks professional

### Eliminates Outsourcing
- No more sending jobs out for litho-perf on press
- No special die with micro-perf steel rule needed
- Handle perforation in-house, inline with folding

### Break-Resistant Design
- **Double bevel construction** much stronger than traditional single bevel
- Cuts against softer nylon rather than steel
- "Never break a perf blade again"

### Laser Printer Compatible
- Produces sheets that run through laser printers and copiers without jamming
- Critical for variable data printing workflows

### Saves Press Blankets
- "Save thousands of pounds on smashed printing press blankets"
- Perforation done on folder, not press

### Kiss-Cut Technology
- Perf wheel mounted on shock-absorbing cushion
- More precise kiss-cut adds to knife longevity
- Minimizes disruption to sheet, cleaner/finer cut
- Sheet lays flat after perforation

### Sheet Stability
- Two rubber grippers adjacent to perf wheel
- Prevents "tailing" (sheet wandering)
- Maximizes sheet grip for consistent results
