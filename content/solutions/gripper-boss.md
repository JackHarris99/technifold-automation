# Gripper Boss Technology

> Superior replacement for OEM pull-out/gripper wheels - re-grip in seconds, not days

## What It Does

Replaces OEM gripper wheels (pull-out wheels) with a two-part system:
- **Metal wheel with replaceable gripper bands** (top)
- **Full metal wheel** (bottom)

When grippers wear out, simply rip out and replace the bands - no machine stripping, no sending away, no waiting.

## Machine Type

**All machine types** - Folders, Binders, Stitchers

## The Problem It Solves

### OEM Gripper Wheel Issues

OEM gripper wheels have a fundamental design flaw:
- **Metal + rubber bonding** wears down over time
- When grip fails, entire wheel must be replaced or re-gripped
- **Re-gripping requires**:
  - Stripping the machine
  - Sending wheels away to specialist
  - Days or weeks of waiting
  - Expensive rebuild costs
- **Full replacement** is even more expensive
- **OEM rubber quality** often poor - doesn't last

### The Business Impact
- Unplanned downtime when grippers fail
- Rush charges for urgent re-gripping
- Production delays waiting for wheels
- Poor sheet handling affects quality
- Maintenance budget unpredictability

## Key Benefits

### Re-Grip in SECONDS
- Just rip out old gripper bands
- Push in new bands
- Back in production immediately
- No machine stripping required
- No sending wheels away

### Superior Grip
- Better sheet grip than OEM rubber
- More consistent sheet movement
- Longer lasting before change needed
- Premium rubber compound

### Cost Effective
- Gripper bands fraction of wheel replacement cost
- No specialist re-gripping charges
- No rush delivery fees
- Predictable maintenance costs
- Stock bands on-site for instant changes

### Minimal Downtime
- Change bands between jobs
- No waiting for external services
- Production continues same day

### Better Results
- Superior grip improves registration
- Consistent sheet transport
- Fewer misfeeds and jams
- Recommended alongside Technifold specialised tooling

## How It Works

### The Two-Part System

```
    ┌──────────────────┐
    │  GRIPPER BOSS    │  ← Metal wheel with 2 gripper bands
    │  [Band] [Band]   │     Bands are replaceable
    └──────────────────┘
    ┌──────────────────┐
    │  METAL WHEEL     │  ← Full metal wheel (lower)
    │                  │     Long-lasting, no wear parts
    └──────────────────┘
```

### Band Replacement Process
1. Identify worn gripper bands
2. Pull/rip out old bands from wheel
3. Warm new bands slightly (makes insertion easier)
4. Push new bands into wheel grooves
5. Resume production

## Consumable: Gripper Bands

### Available Types

| Band Type | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| M-88 Black Gripper Bands | Standard applications |
| Other colours/types | Specific machine requirements |

### Installation Tips
- Warm bands before insertion for easier fit
- Ensure bands seat fully in grooves
- Check grip before resuming production
