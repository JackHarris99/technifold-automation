# Spine-Creaser Technology

> Single spine crease for saddle stitchers - eliminates cover cracking on magazines and booklets

## What It Does

Creates a single, precise crease on the spine of magazine and booklet covers **inline** on saddle stitching machines. The crease is applied after the cover feeder and before stitching, preventing fibre cracking when the finished product is opened.

## Machine Type

**Saddle Stitchers** - sits in the cover feeder section
