# Section-Scorer Technology

> 3x deeper scoring for multiple-up section/signature work on folding machines

## What It Does

Replacement scoring device for folding machines that produces **3 times deeper scores** than OEM tools. Specifically designed for 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-page signature work, but versatile enough for everyday use on all folded media.

## Machine Type

**Folding Machines** - replaces OEM scoring tools

## The Problem It Solves

### OEM Scoring Tools Are Fundamentally Flawed

OEM scoring tools have **not evolved since 1850**. They:
- Retain the same destructive V-shaped design
- Create shallow, ineffective indentations
- Cause fold wrinkles (crow's feet)
- Don't keep pace with modern folding technology
- Require operator guesswork
- Produce inconsistent results

### The Impact on Section/Signature Work
- Sections don't fold tightly enough for downstream processes
- Inconsistent folding causes registration problems
- Crow's feet wrinkles affect appearance
- Operators struggle to find correct settings

## Key Benefits

### 3x Deeper Scoring
- Penetrates 3 times deeper than OEM tools
- Ensures 100% consistent folding with the score
- Sections fold tight for perfect registration

### Eliminates Guesswork
- 8 in-built score settings to choose from
- Colour-coded scoring ribs match stock weights
- Even inexperienced operators become scoring experts instantly
- Takes away all operator guesswork

### Fast Setup
- Split scoring ribs for quick insertion into male hub
- Male hub split design opens/closes to lock ribs securely
- Quick and easy changeover between settings
- Simple instruction guide - up and running in minutes

### Reduces Fold Wrinkles
- Eliminates crow's feet
- Clean, professional folds
- Consistent results across entire run

## Technical Specifications

### Score Settings
- **8 adjustable settings** of varying widths and depths
- Covers full range from light to heavy stocks

### Scoring Ribs
- **4 colour-coded ribs** dictating score depth by stock weight
- Non-abrasive plastic construction
- Split design for fast insertion

### Female Channels
- **8 female channels** creating required score widths
- Pre-determined widths for different folded media
- Colour-coded to match male ribs

### Design Features
- Male hub with split design for secure locking
- Quick insertion without removing from machine
- Self-centering alignment

## Colour-Coding System

The colour-coding system eliminates operator guesswork:

| Male Rib Color | Female Channel | Stock Type |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| (Colour-coded) | (Matching) | Light |
| (Colour-coded) | (Matching) | Medium |
| (Colour-coded) | (Matching) | Heavy |
| (Colour-coded) | (Matching) | Extra Heavy |

*Match the rib colour to the channel colour for your stock weight*

## Application Types

### Signature Work (Primary Application)
- 4-page sections
- 8-page sections
- 16-page sections
- 32-page sections
- 64-page sections

### General Folding
- Everyday folding operations
- Full range of media types
- Any job requiring consistent scoring

## Why Signatures Need Better Scoring

For book and magazine production, sections must:
1. Fold tightly and consistently
2. Register precisely with other sections
3. Feed correctly through binding equipment
4. Maintain flat, wrinkle-free appearance

OEM scoring simply isn't deep enough to achieve this. The Section-Scorer's 3x deeper score ensures sections fold exactly where intended, every time.
