## Core Technology: The Reverse Crease Method

**The Breakthrough Discovery** (Graham Harris, founder):
- Crease on TOP (outside) so bulge/bead is visible on INSIDE after folding
- "No matter how hard and deep the crease was applied it would almost always crack open if folded the wrong way"
- Tested 5 leading scoring devices worldwide before inventing Tri-Creaser
- Results matched proven Heidelberg Cylinder method

**Why It Works**:
- Specially formulated rubber creasing rib (not destructive steel)
- U-shaped crease profile (spreads pressure) vs V-shaped score (concentrates pressure)
- Penetrates material up to 3x deeper without splitting
- Multiple crease permutations for different materials

## Key Differentiators vs OEM/Competition

| Feature | OEM Scoring Tools | Tri-Creaser |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Technology | Unchanged since 1850 | Patented rubber rib system |
| Crease Shape | V-shaped (damages fibres) | U-shaped (spreads pressure) |
| Settings | 1 fixed setting | 8 adjustable settings |
| Depth | Shallow | 3x deeper without damage |
| Digital Stocks | Poor results | Excellent (rubber is "digital friendly") |
| Changeover | Machine disassembly | Seconds (Fast-Fit) |

## Color-Coded Creasing Ribs

| Color | Stock Range | Hardness |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Orange | 85-200gsm | Hardest (longest life) |
| Blue | 200-270gsm | Medium |
| Yellow | 250-350gsm | Softest |

## Statistics & Proof Points

- **30,000+ companies** using Tri-Creaser worldwide
- **40,000+ Fast-Fit installations**
- **100% elimination** of fibre cracking
- **ROI in 1-3 job runs**
- **10x faster** than flatbed cylinder process
- **Savings**: £10,000-£30,000+ per year for some companies

## Third-Party Validation

**Sappi Paper Engineering Report**:
> "The quality of this creasing is comparable with that produced in letterpress printing"

Sappi testing showed:
- Conventional creasing "not satisfactory" on high basis weights
- Tri-Creaser achieved "optimal result" even on 350 g/m² HannoArt Matt

## Consumable Longevity (35mm shaft)

| Rib Color | Standard Life | EnduraCrease Life |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Orange | 1,000,000 sheets | 1,300,000 sheets |
| Blue | 600,000 sheets | 780,000 sheets |
| Yellow | 300,000 sheets | 390,000 sheets |

**Note**: 25mm shaft devices have ~40% shorter life

## Common Myths BUSTED

1. **Myth**: Always fold with the grain
   - **Truth**: On 7-15pt stocks, better results folding AGAINST grain

2. **Myth**: Can't crease in rotary form
   - **Truth**: Incremental delamination in rotary works just as well

3. **Myth**: Can't charge extra without letterpress
   - **Truth**: Deliver premium results, get premium pricing

4. **Myth**: Can't use UV coating on folded pieces
   - **Truth**: Good crease eliminates cracking even on UV
