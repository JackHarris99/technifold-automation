# Spine and Hinge Creaser Technology

> Four-crease book cover preparation on folding machines for manual binding workflows

## What It Does

Creates up to **4 deep creases** on book covers using a folding machine - the same spine and hinge pattern as the Quad-Creaser, but designed for:
- Manual binding workflows
- Binders without cover feeders
- Offline cover preparation before binding

## Machine Type

**Folding Machines** - attaches to folder exit shafts

## Why Crease Covers on a Folder?

Not all binderies have cover feeders on their perfect binders. Many operations:
- Use manual cover feeding
- Process covers in batches before binding
- Need offline cover preparation for specialty work
- Have older binders without integrated creasing

The Spine & Hinge Creaser brings the same 4-crease capability to these workflows.

## Key Benefits

### Eliminates Dual Problems
1. **Laminate lifting** on coated/laminated covers
2. **Fibre cracking** on the spine and hinges

### Letterpress-Quality Results
- Deep, clean creases without fibre damage
- Professional finish on all stock types
- No ripping or tearing

### Versatility
- Can crease both sides of cover
- Adjustable for any spine width
- Works on folders and capacity wallets
- Colour-coded creasing bands for different stock grades

### Stock Compatibility
- UV coated stocks
- Laminated stocks
- Digitally printed stocks
- Light to heavy weights (70-350gsm)

## Technical Specifications

### Package Contents (Typical)
- 4x Male/Female components with bearings

## The Crease Pattern

```
|←-- Spine Width --→|
[Hinge][Spine Crease 1][Spine][Spine Crease 2][Hinge]
```

Four creases total:
1. Left hinge crease
2. Left spine crease
3. Right spine crease
4. Right hinge crease

## Machine Compatibility

Works on most popular folding machine brands:
- MBO
- Stahl/Heidelberg
- Horizon
- Morgana
- GUK
- And others

## Use Cases

### Perfect Bound Book Covers
- Pre-crease covers before manual application to book block
- Ensures clean spine and flexible hinges

### Folders and Wallets
- Capacity wallets requiring spine creases
- Presentation folders with multiple crease lines

### Specialty Work
- Short runs where inline creasing not economical
- Mixed-format jobs requiring different spine widths
- Test runs before full production

## Comparison: Spine & Hinge vs Quad-Creaser

| Feature | Spine & Hinge Creaser | Quad-Creaser |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| Machine Type | Folding machines | Perfect binders |
| Workflow | Offline, before binding | Inline with binding |
| Creases | Up to 4 | Up to 4 |
| Use Case | Manual binding | Automated binding |
| Speed | Depends on folder | Binder speed |

## Historical Note

Older documentation may refer to the binder version as "Spine and Hinge" - this has been renamed to "Quad-Creaser" to reduce confusion between the folder and binder products.
