# Web-Tool Category

> NOTE: This is NOT a separate product category

## Clarification

After reviewing the source documents, files named "Web..." (e.g., "Web page Tri-Creaser", "Web Spine & Hinge") are **website page content** for other product categories, not a separate "Web-Tool" product line.

There is no distinct "Web-Tool" product category in the Technifold range.

## What the "Web" Files Contain

The source PDF files starting with "Web" are marketing materials prepared for the Technifold website:

| Web page Tri-Creaser Fast Fit.pdf | Tri-Creaser |

| Web page Quad Creaser.pdf | Quad-Creaser |
| Web page Section Score.pdf | Section-Scorer |
