# CP Applicator Technology

> Close Proximity creasing and perforating - as little as 5mm apart

## UNIQUE SELLING POINT

**"Completely unique to the global market"** - No other manufacturer offers this type of application.

This is **PATENTED** technology that enables crease and perforation combinations that standard tools physically cannot achieve because they can't get close enough together.

## What It Does

Produces two almost invisible micro-perforations as little as **5mm apart**, with optional creasing in between. The specially designed holder allows crease and perf combinations impossible with standard single tools.

## Configurations

### Perf-Crease-Perf
- Perforation → Crease → Perforation
- Spacing: **5mm - 45mm** apart
- Perfect for tear-off sections with a fold in between

### Double Perf
- Two perforations close together
- Spacing: **5mm - 50mm** apart
- For parallel tear-off lines

### Close Proximity Creasing + Perforating
- Any combination of crease and perf elements
- Fully adjustable for quick changeover

## Technical Specifications

| Feature | Specification |
|---------|--------------|

## Perfect Applications

- **Vouchers** with tear-off perforation close to fold
- **Tickets** with stub separation
- **Coupons** requiring clean tear near spine
- **Rip-out order forms** needing perforation close to binding edge
- Any application requiring **tear-off perfs close to the fold**

## Why Standard Tools Can't Do This

Standard single micro-perforators and creasing tools have physical width limitations. Even mounting two tools side-by-side, the minimum spacing is typically 15-20mm+.

The CP Applicator's **integrated design** allows the perforation and crease elements to be positioned much closer - down to **5mm** apart.

## Customer Testimonial

**Joe Doran, Typecraft Ltd, Ireland**:
> "The CP-Applicator was brilliant for us"

## Machine Compatibility

Works on most popular types of:
- Folding machines
- Rotary creasing machines

## Comparison: CP Applicator vs Standard Tools

| Feature | Standard Tools | CP Applicator |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Min Spacing | 15-20mm+ | 5mm |
| Crease + Perf Combo | Requires 2 separate tools | Single integrated unit |
| Setup Complexity | Multiple adjustments | Single unit adjustment |
| Speed | Slower (multiple passes possible) | 5x faster |

## Notes for Marketing

- Emphasize **UNIQUE** and **PATENTED** - no competition
- Lead with the problem: "Need perfs close to the fold?"
- This solves a specific, common problem in finishing
- Premium positioning justified by unique capability
